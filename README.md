This shows my blender made inspired on the Mars Rover at planet Mars where he lifts up a rock.
I also have some bases of my project just for testing like the robot arm animation and the wheels spinning motors.
The part2 is using Blender's game engne to move the Robot and to rotate the camera and his arms using your keyboard
Feel free to look around!!!!
