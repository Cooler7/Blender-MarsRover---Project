This shows my blender made inspired on the Mars Rover at planet Mars where he lifts up a rock.
I also have some bases of my project just for testing like the robot arm animation and the wheels spinning motors.
The part2 is using Blender's game engne to move the Robot and to rotate the camera and his arms using your keyboard

In this picture the tires may look like they are clipping throuh the floor BUT! I put them like that to create the effect that they are buried in the sand.

Feel free to look around!!!!
